# üéµ Ishi Music Bot - Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### 1. **Interaction Timeout Issues**

- **Problem**: `DiscordAPIError[10062]: Unknown interaction` and `DiscordAPIError[40060]: Interaction has already been acknowledged`
- **Root Cause**: DisTube operations were taking too long, causing Discord interaction tokens to expire
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `await` from DisTube play operations to respond immediately
  - Added proper error handling for expired interactions
  - Let DisTube handle success/failure messages through its event system

### 2. **Deprecated Ephemeral Usage**

- **Problem**: Warning: `Supplying "ephemeral" for interaction response options is deprecated. Utilize flags instead.`
- **Root Cause**: Discord.js v14 changed the API for ephemeral messages
- **Solution**:
  - Updated all commands to use `flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral` instead of `ephemeral: true`
  - Added `MessageFlags` import to all command files
  - Created and ran automation script to fix all files

### 3. **Missing Imports**

- **Problem**: `PermissionFlagsBits` was used but not imported in play.js
- **Solution**: Added proper imports for Discord.js components

### 4. **Error Handling Improvements**

- **Problem**: Bot would crash when interaction responses failed
- **Solution**:
  - Added try-catch blocks around interaction responses
  - Fallback to channel messages when interaction expires
  - Improved error logging
